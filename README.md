# Front-End Capstone: Family Junction

This project serves as the culmination of the development portion of my front-end development certification before moving into the UX design portion. It's a full-functionality website that emphasizes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The project utilizes Firebase for data management, and Postman for API testing, and is built using Next.js/React and styled with Bootstrap and HTML/CSS.

## Project Overview

Family Junction is a  simple and clean space for families to plan their events. 

This CRUD application represents the culmination of 6 months of study starting with no coding knowledge. I worked solo on planning, architecting, and building core functionality while seeking peer help to overcome hurdles along the way. The minimum viable product goal was basic CRUD functionality - creating, reading, updating, and deleting core data. Through iterative design, I was able to achieve this MVP. This project improved both my programming skills and ability to self-direct complex projects.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js/React**: Used for building the front end of the application.
- **Firebase**: Utilized for data management, storage, or authentication.
- **Postman**: Employed for API testing and verification.
- **Bootstrap**: Utilized for styling and front-end design.
- **Miro**: Used for prototyping

## Features

- **Create**: Users can create new family event entries by providing details such as title, date, location, and description.
- **Read**: Existing family events are displayed in an easy-to-read format showing salient details, with the ability to expand the event to access full descriptions and data.
- **Update**: Users can update any aspect of previously created family event entries as needed - making changes to titles, dates, locations, etc.
- **Delete**: Existing entries for family events can be deleted with a simple user confirmation required before permanent removal.
- **Filtering**: Extra functionality exists to easily filter and search family events based on keywords
